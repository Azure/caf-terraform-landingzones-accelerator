# Cloud Adoption Framework landing zones for Terraform - Starter template

## Where are the examples? 

This directory was previously hosting configuration examples for demo, sandpit scenarios. 

We got your feedbacks it's hard to customize and compose a complete environment, so we automated everything for you! 
Examples in this directory are still available if you pick previous versions or tags of this repo but we no longer maintain or support them.

## Let's get started!

In order to get started with the automated configuration generator (rover ignite), we recommend that you start reading the documentation on https://aka.ms/caf/terraform and [start deploying here](https://aztfmod.github.io/documentation/docs/enterprise-scale/landingzones/eslz-intro)!
