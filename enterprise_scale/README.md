# Enterprise-Scale Construction Sets for Azure Terraform Landing Zones

Enterprise-scale is an architectural approach and a reference implementation that enables effective construction and operationalization of landing zones on Azure, at scale. This approach aligns with the Azure roadmap and the Cloud Adoption Framework for Azure.

This repository provides a set of approved reference implementation

| Solution | Landing zone | Construction set |
|----------|--------------|-----|
| AKS - Kubernetes | Online | aks secure baseline |
| | |

This implementation is based on [Cloud Adoption Framework Landing Zones for Terraform best practices](https://github.com/Azure/caf-terraform-landingzones).

## Prerequisites

There is required access and tooling you'll need in order to accomplish this. Follow the instructions below and on the subsequent pages so that you can get your environment ready to proceed with the AKS cluster creation.




1. An Azure subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).

   > :warning: The user or service principal initiating the deployment process _must_ have the following minimal set of Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) roles:
   >
   > * [Contributor role](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor) is _required_ at the subscription level to have the ability to create resource groups and perform deployments.
   > * [User Access Administrator role](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#user-access-administrator) is _required_ at the subscription level since you'll be granting least-privilege RBAC access to managed identities.
   >   * One such example is detailed in the [Container Insights documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-monitor/insights/container-insights-troubleshoot#authorization-error-during-onboarding-or-update-operation).

2. An Azure AD tenant to associate your Kubernetes RBAC configuration to.

   > :warning: The user or service principal initiating the deployment process _must_ have the following minimal set of Azure AD permissions assigned:
   >
   > * Azure AD [User Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/users-groups-roles/directory-assign-admin-roles#user-administrator-permissions) is _required_ to create a "break glass" AKS admin Active Directory Security Group and User. Alternatively, you could get your Azure AD admin to create this for you when instructed to do so.
   >   * If you are not part of the User Administrator group in the tenant associated to your Azure subscription, please consider [creating a new tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-access-create-new-tenant#create-a-new-tenant-for-your-organization) to use while evaluating this implementation.
3. Clone/download this repo locally, or even better fork this repository.

   > :twisted_rightwards_arrows: If you have forked this reference implementation repo, you'll be able to customize some of the files and commands for a more personalized experience; also ensure references to repos mentioned are updated to use your own (e.g. the following `GITHUB_REPO`).

   ```bash
   export GITHUB_REPO=https://github.com/Azure/caf-terraform-landingzones-starter.git
   git clone $GITHUB_REPO

   cd caf-terraform-landingzones-starter
   git pull
   ```

3. The steps shown here and elsewhere in the reference implementation use Bash shell commands. On Windows, you can use the Ubuntu on [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/wsl/about#what-is-wsl-2) to run Bash. Once your bash shell is up you will need to install these prerequisites.

   Latest [Ansible documentation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/index.html)

   ```bash
   sudo apt install ansible
   ```

    The ansible will deploy the following tools on your local machine.
   | Tool | Landing zone |
   | ----------|--------------|
   | azure-cli | Azure command line tool |
   | kubectl   | Kubernetes command line |
   | terraform | Terraform binary |
   | jq        | Json parse command line |
    | | |

   ```bash
   cd enterprise_scale

   sudo ansible-playbook pre-requisites-tools.yaml
   ```
