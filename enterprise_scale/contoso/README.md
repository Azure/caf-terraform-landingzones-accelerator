# Cloud Adoption Framework landing zones for Terraform - Starter template for Contoso

## Review the demo.yaml

The demo.yaml contains all parameters to build your Contoso demo environment. To get started quickly you need to change and review few paramters.

Change the name of the tenant you are planning to use for the deployments.
```yaml
# Set the Azure Active Directory tenant name. Do not include the .onmicrosoft.com
# Line 20
tenant_name: set_your_tenant_name
```

Set the email addresses to receive the notifications
```yaml
# Line 26
notifications:
  service_health_alerts:
      email1:
        email_address: change_email@domain.com

```

Review the regions you want to use. Do not change the name of the keys (i.e region1 and region2)
```yaml
# Line 47 and 50
  regions:
    region1:
      name: southeastasia
      slug: sea
    region2:
      name: eastasia
      slug: ea
  tags:

```

## Generate the configuration files

```bash

export AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID=$(az account show --query id -o tsv)

# Generate the contoso demo files (only this scenario is supported at the moment. More to come)
cd /tf/caf/templates/platform && \
ansible-playbook e2e.yaml \
  -e base_templates_folder=/tf/caf/templates/platform \
  -e config_folder=/tf/caf/enterprise_scale/contoso/platform \
  -e scenario=contoso \
  -e model=demo

```
